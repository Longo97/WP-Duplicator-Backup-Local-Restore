# WP-Duplicator-Backup-Local-Restore
A script that automates the creation of a local WordPress server based on a Duplicator backup using Docker.

# Prerequisites
Please make sure you have docker installed and running on your system.

# Usage
First, you need to have downloaded the **zip file** and the **installer.php file** generated by **Duplicator** from your WordPress website. Once you've done that, clone this repository into the folder of your preference and place the Duplicator files inside the **'Source'** folder. <br/>
**WARNING:** Make sure that the installer file by Duplicator is named exactly **installer.php**<br/><br/>
To start the script, run the command inside a terminal in the folder where you have cloned the repository, where the script is located:
```console
source docker_wp_create.sh
```
Now you have to follow the prompts inside the terminal. Once the server is up and running the page to restore the Duplicator backup will open. <br/><br/>
When you are asked to connect to the database, the values that you need to insert are:
* **Host:** db
* **Database:** wordpress
* **User:** The user you choose inside the terminal (Default is **admin**)
* **Password:** The password you choose inside the terminal (Default is **admin**)
